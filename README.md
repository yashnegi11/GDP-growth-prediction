# üåç GDP Growth Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores the use of **machine learning models** to predict **GDP growth rates** of countries using a range of **macroeconomic indicators**. By leveraging historical data from the **World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI)**, the aim is to build a predictive system that can offer insights into how economic factors correlate and influence a nation's economic growth.

---

## üìå Project Objective

To develop a robust machine learning model that predicts the **annual GDP growth (%)** of countries using features such as:

- Inflation (Consumer Price Index)
- Unemployment Rate
- Gross Capital Formation
- Final consumption growth
- Trade openness
- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
- Sector Growth
- GDP Growth lag1
- GDP Growth lag2
- Export & Import growth
- Others...

## üß† Why This Project Matters

Understanding GDP growth is crucial for:
- Governments to design effective fiscal and monetary policies
- Investors to assess economic health and market potential
- Researchers to study long-term economic trends

By predicting GDP growth, we help stakeholders make informed decisions and reduce uncertainty.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Collected indicators from World Bank via API.
- Unified them into a single DataFrame indexed by `Country`, `Year`.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Visualised and handled **missing data** via visual analysis and imputation.
- Detected(using boxplot) and handled **outliers**(using IQR, capping).
- Used forward-fill & backward-fill per country group.
- Detected and removed **outliers**.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Visualized trends per country (e.g., India, USA, China).
- Examined correlation heatmaps between features and target.
- Identified important predictive patterns.

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
- Create new features.
- Normalized or scaled skewed features.
- Selected most relevant features using correlation and domain logic.

### 5. **Modeling**
- Applied baseline models: **Linear Regression**, **Ridge**, **Lasso**
- Tried advanced methods: **Random Forest Regressor**, **Gradient Boosting**, **XGBoosting**.
- Evaluated models with RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ metrics.

### 6. **Prediction & Analysis**
- Visualized predictions vs. actual values.
- Compared performance across models and countries.
- Discussed economic interpretation of model results.

## üîç Key Findings

- Macroeconomic indicators can effectively predict GDP growth, especially with advanced ensemble models.
- XGBoost outperformed all other models with an R¬≤ of 0.9581 on the test set, indicating strong predictive power.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that factors like investment rate, exports, government spending, and inflation control had high predictive influence.
- Regularized models (Ridge/Lasso) performed better than plain linear regression, but tree-based models captured non-linearity more effectively.
- Regularized models (Ridge/Lasso) performed better than plain linear regression, but tree-based models captured non-linearity more effectively.

- Explore **Time Series Forecasting** using LSTM or ARIMA.
- Introduce **categorical features** like income group or region.
- Develop an **interactive dashboard** to visualize trends dynamically.
